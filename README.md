WEATHER FORECAST APP OVERVIEW:

A Weather Forecast App in HTML is a web application that displays weather information for a specific location using an external weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI). This project typically involves a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with data fetched from a weather service API.

Hereâ€™s an overview of how the components work together to create a weather forecast app:


HTML provides the basic layout of the app, which typically includes:

Input Field: A field for users to enter a city or location name.
Button: A button that triggers the weather search when clicked.
Weather Display: Sections to show the fetched weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, conditions).
